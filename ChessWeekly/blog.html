						<p>The London System is an excellent beginner-friendly opening. 
						It makes intuitive sense, it sets itself up quickly, and it translates to higher levels well.</p>
						<h3>Top Tips</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Always check your opponent’s move before making your own.</li>
							<li>Castle to the opposite side to your opponent and use your pawns to push into their territory!</li>
							<li>Rather than trading dark squared bishops, move it back to g3 and re-capture with your h pawn. This will open your rook for a strong attack!</li>
							<li>Move your queen to c2 and see if your opponent notices that you are attacking their h pawn. This also allows you to castle queenside if needed.</li>
							<li>If your opponent seems solid, castle king side and move your rook to e1. This will reinforce your e pawn and allow you to push it into  their territory!</li>

						<h3>Top Tips</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Always check your opponent’s move before making your own.</li>
							<li>If you can grab more space by playing e5 then do it!</li>
							<li>If you played e5 then develop your light squared bishop to e6, if not then play b6 then bishop to b6. Be careful about opening this line to your rook, make sure you get a piece on that diagonal before your opponent!</li>
							<li>Develop your other knight to either d7 or c6.</li>
							<li>Be careful about the diagonal line to your king, it may be wise to play h6 and tuck your king into h7 for safety.</li>
							<li>Make sure to develop your queen to enable your rooks to become connected.</li>

						<p>If you're bored of the Queen's Gambit Declined, struggling against the London, or want to tempt d4 players into a French, give the diverse 
						Horwitz opening a try.</p>
						<p>London: If your opponent continues their plan of playing the London, you can immediately follow up with a quick c5! This move is multi-purpose. 
						Firstly, if your opponent decides to capture this pawn, you can immediately re-capture with your bishop, for quick development. If your opponent 
						plays Nf3 or e3, then the plan is play Qb6! This move has two threats. Firstly, you are pressuring the center with an x-ray attack on your opponents d4 pawn.
						Secondly, you are threatening to take on b2. This pawn will be hard to defend without making concessions on the dark squares on your opponent's queenside. 
						These tips will allow you to play aggressively against the somewhat passive London.</p>	
						<p>e4: Without immediate pressure on the centre, your opponent may believe you are going for a passive setup such as the hedgehog. Some players when 
						faced with this situation go back to their first-principles of chess, namely, control the centre. This may tempt a usual d4 player to opt for the 
						move e4 for their second move. We follow this up with a quick d5, now transposing into a main-line French defence! If you are unfamiliar with the 
						plans of the French you may see this as a disadvantage. However, we advise training in the french as your d4 playing opponent will not have much 
						practice in this line and may make easy mistakes for you to capitalise on! One quick tip we will give will be to transfer your g8 knight to f5 using 
						the e7 square, for the most effecctive pressure on the opponent's centre.</p>	
						<p>c4: If your opponent opts for c4 anyway, potentially following their Queen's Gambit line regardless of your move, we can reply with 
						either d5 or Nf6. By playing d5 we transpose into the Queen's Gambit Declined, a solid but usually slow and boring opening. Alternatively we 
						may play Nf6, transposing into an Indian defense. This opening scores better for black and can give more diverse games than the QGD. We won't go too 
						much into the theory of the indian here, await our next article where we will cover this opening!</p>	
						<p>Others: If your opponent plays many other moves, most likely you wil go for an Indian set-up with an immediate Nf6. </p>	
						<p> Thats it for the Horwitz, give it a try then come back and leave a comment with how you got on!</p>
